# ML_JS
This is a basic machine learning library for linear and logistic regression, the fundamental hyper-parameter settings (learning rate, lambda, iterations) are included. 

You can use it by copying the entire function to the source code or create your own library by modifying it.

I expected there is a lot of room to be improved for the algorithm. In case you (lucky enough to) find any of the bugs or have any feedback positive or negative, I am really looking forward to knowing it, and will try my best to make this work better!

### Linear regression
Linear regression are realized in two approaches: gradient descent and vectorization
#### gradient descent
```js
//Load the training sets
var train_X = train_X();
var train_Y = train_Y();
```
